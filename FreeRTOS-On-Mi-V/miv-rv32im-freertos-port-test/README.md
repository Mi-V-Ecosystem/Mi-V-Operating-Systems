## FreeRTOS port for Mi-V Soft Processor

### Test Platform and FPGA design:
M2S150-Advanced-Dev-Kit
[SmartFusion2 Advanced Development Kit RISC-V Sample Design](https://github.com/RISCV-on-Microsemi-FPGA/M2S150-Advanced-Dev-Kit/blob/master/Programming_The_Target_Device/PROC_SUBSYSTEM_BaseDesign)    

### How to run the FreeRTOS RISC-V port:
To know how to use the SoftConsole workspace, please refer the [Readme.md](https://github.com/RISCV-on-Microsemi-FPGA/SoftConsole/blob/master/ExampleWorkspace/README.md)

The miv-rv32im-freertos-port-test is a self contained project. This project demonstrates 
the FreeRTOS running with Microsemi RISC-V processor. This project creates  two 
tasks and runs them at regular intervals.
    
This example project requires USB-UART interface to be connected to a host PC. 
The host PC must connect to the serial port using a terminal emulator such as 
TeraTerm or PuTTY configured as follows:
    
        - 115200 baud
        - 8 data bits
        - 1 stop bit
        - no parity
        - no flow control
    
The ./hw_platform.h file contains the design related information that is required 
for this project. If you update the design, the hw_platform.h must be updated 
accordingly.
